# Minecraft-Network
Setup your own copy of the ORE Minecraft Network. This is currently a labor intensive procedure that is completely manual. Any points in the todo-list that isn't done, will be assumed done manually by the finished products. This is why the priority is ordered seemingly backwards. I am automating the last step of the setup first and building my way up.

## TODO List
Points will be in the order of priority. The things that are not done will be assumed done by the implemented systems.
+ Setup plugins from a config.
+ Setup each Minecraft server.
+ Setup the proxy to make a network from the minecraft servers.
